# [About](https://github.com/lumaalberto/About/edit/master/README.md)
My name is Alberto Luma. I studied civil engineering and manufacturing engineering. I have a masters degree in manufacturing engineering. I currently mange the engineering technology program at Lake-Sumter State College in Florida. I also work as a engineering consultant in Central Florida. I am a current student at Bellevue University in the Data Science program. My goal is to complete this degree this summer. This degree will help me a lot with my current engineering consulting business.


# [Project I: Analytics-Projects](https://github.com/lumaalberto/Analytics-Projects/edit/master/README.md)
These projects mostly focus on linear regression analysis. OLS is a variation of linear regression, a statistical method that examines associations between multiple independent variables and a single dependent variable; once the assumptions are satisfied, the regression output indicates the strength of the association between the dependent variable and each of the independent variables. These assumptions, include linear parameters, random sampling, no multicollinearity, no autocorrelation, a conditional mean of zero, and normally distributed error terms; all of them were satisfied, meaning that our OLS models are efficient and represent a linear unbiased estimator of variable coefficients. 
I also believe that simple linear regression may be a great way to examine my single input. Because simple linear regression requires statistical properties from the data such as means, standard deviations, correlations, and covariance, all the data must be available to traverse and calculate statistics.


# [Project II: Advanced-Data-Visualization-Projects](https://github.com/lumaalberto/Advanced-Data-Visualization-Projects/edit/master/README.md)
These project are mostly focused on interactive visualization such as heat map that can show the seismic intensity of each place on the map and the distribution of the seismic intensity, bubble chart which is a multivariate chart that is a variant of a scatter plot, and dadar charts are used to compare multiple quantized variables, such as seeing which variables have similar values, or if there are extreme values. They also help to observe which variables in the data set have higher or lower values.


# [Project III: Data-Presentation-Projects](https://github.com/lumaalberto/Data-Presentation-Projects/edit/master/README.md)
I started this project on Tuesday night. I just completed it this Saturday afternoon. I was getting so many errors throughout the project that I was about to give up. It is extremely stressful when I understand something but I am not getting the result that I expect. Then, I decided to use another approach which worked for me perfectly. I decided to stop working on the project and read the book so I could have a better understanding of what my result should be. Throughout the project, there has been one major question that I kept in mind because I wanted to focus on a great result. What have I learned so far in during this course to make my project easier to complete?
Well, I had learned that Data Wrangling is the process of transforming or cleansing data that flows from a source to a target. Just like when cleaning data, the most important things is to know what size of data that I am dealing with. Data wrangling is actually the same process. For small datasets that can be opened in excel, the transformations of cleansing rules can be defined in excel through the help of macros. When the dataset size is such that it cannot be opened in excel you can then use scripting or programming languages to do the same operation and schedule them using the schedulers mentioned example. Such scripting languages are typically running on a single machine and the performance is directly proportional to the configuration of the machine. When the dataset is large, opening in excel is not possible and running the cleansing rule on a single machine can be slow. This is where Big Data technologies such as Map reduce and Spark shine where a subset of data is sent to multiple machines and the cleansing rule is applied on each machine on the subset of data thereby increasing the throughput of the entire processing.


# [Project IV: Data-Visualization-Projects](https://github.com/lumaalberto/Data-Visualization-Projects/edit/master/README.md)
These are random projects that I have worked on in the past few months. They are mostly created to help me understand structured or unstructured data graphically to present information hidden in the data directly to people.


# [Project V: Rent-Analysis-in-Orlando-](https://github.com/lumaalberto/Rent-Analysis-in-Orlando-/edit/master/README.md)
Analyzing rent increase in Orlando, Florida 
Orlando’s population grew from 2,512,917 to 2,772,962 from July 2018 to July 2019, a difference of 259,775. About 1.1 million people were employed in the area, and total wages for the quarter that ended on March 31, 2014, were over $10 billion, a one-year increase of 4.7 percent. The average annualized salary was $42,644, a one-year increase of 2.6 percent. 
The demand for housing in the Greater Orlando Area has been significantly increased in the past 20 years. At $1,151, real median gross rent in Orlando was at its highest level in 2017 since the series began in 2005. At $1,170, real average gross rent in Orlando was at its highest level in 2017 since the series began in 2005. The median rent more accurately depicts rental rates in the middle of the distribution of rents and is thus preferred in the analysis below. 2018 Orlando median and average rent data will be released in September of 2019.


# [Project VI: Income-Inequality-in-the-United-States](https://github.com/lumaalberto/Income-Inequality-in-the-United-States/edit/master/README.md)
Income inequality is defined as the extent to which income is distributed unevenly in a group of people. In mostly every culture, most people’s economic positions are also related to other characteristics, such as whether or not they have a disability, their ethnic background, or whether they are a man or a woman. Of course, if we are referring to income as monetary aspect, we can clearly say that income is not just the money received through pay, but all the money received from employment, investments, such as interest on savings accounts and dividends from shares of stock, savings, state benefits, pensions, and rent. Ethnically speaking, Blacks and Hispanics have faced economic inequality for generations, and the recent wave of Black Lives Matter protests has renewed discussions on these disparities. Compared to White families, other races have lower levels of income and net worth. They are also less likely to hold assets of any type. In fact, 19% of Black families have zero or negative net worth, while only 9% of White households have no wealth. 


# [Project VII: Airline-Safety-Dashboard](https://github.com/lumaalberto/Airline-Safety-Dashboard/edit/master/README.md)
This project was very interesting because I had spent a lot of time understanding and learning more about Power BI, which is a program that I truly start to enjoy using. Besides learning Power BI, I had the opportunity to read so many articles about airline safety and airplanes crashes in the past few years. There are a few things that we need to clearly understand when it comes to airline safety.
Last year, 11 of the 20 fatal accidents occurred in North America; however, a significant increase over past years. In 2018 one fatal accident was reported, while in 2017 there were three. Five of the accidents that occurred in North America last year took place in rugged or remote areas of Alaska or Canada. According to David Shepardson, a writer and editor for Reuters.com, the worst airline accident recorded in the U.S. last year followed the February crash of a cargo-carrying Boeing 767 while on approach to Houston’s George Bush Intercontinental Airport. Outside North America, additional accidents occurred in Russia, Mexico, Indonesia, Tanzania, Ukraine, Columbia and the Democratic Republic of Congo. 
For this project, I have used two datasets to complete my Dashboard. The first dataset is the one that was provided by the professor and the second dataset is the one that was required to be used as secondary. 


# [Project VIII: Obesity-and-Poverty-Project](https://github.com/lumaalberto/Obesity-and-Poverty-Project/edit/master/README.md)
Are poverty and obesity associated? 
  Poverty rates and obesity were reviewed across all 51 states in the U.S. In contrast to international trends, people in America who live in the most poverty-dense counties     are those most prone to obesity. States with poverty rates of greater than 35% have obesity rates 145% greater than wealthy counties. 
  
How is poverty linked to obesity? 
  I will prove that individuals who live in impoverished regions have poor access to fresh food. Poverty-dense areas are oftentimes called “food deserts,” implying diminished     access to fresh food. I will also prove the evidence of the association between sedentariness, poor health, obesity, diabetes, other metabolic diseases, and premature death.   Sedentary individuals move 2 hours per day less than active individuals and expend less energy, and they are thereby prone to obesity, chronic metabolic disease, and           cardiovascular death.
  
What can be done to solve the obesity problem? 
  I will create focus on predictive analysis to pinpoint a diverse set of physical activities and nutritional programs in neighborhoods and educational institutions may be the   best way to reduce the risk of obesity among poor youngsters. I will also some such that need reliable Association Between Poverty and Obesity in the United States funding     from governments and charities to boost and leverage valuable programs in neighborhood centers and schools serving disadvantaged Americans.
